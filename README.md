# productsArrivalNotices
During this serious Coronavirus period, hope my Arrival Notices project for products (like face mask, hand sanitizer) in market can help a little bit. :heart:    
<b>[Current Version]</b> This project can help you check whether your ideal products arrive new batch or not.      
<b>[Future version]</b> Can help you detect the process of product in a while loop, until it detects that there is a new batch, it will send you email automatically and shuts down.
